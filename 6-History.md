I have placed this essay under the GNU Free Documentation License. This license is not specifically designed for essays. Essays are usually intended to be coherent and convincing arguments that are written from a single point of view in a single voice. I hope this essay is a short and pleasant read.

It may be arrogance to imagine that this document is worthy of extension; but hope springs eternal. I would be joyous if it were extended in the following ways:

The addition of a comprehensive reading list to each section,

The addition of more and better sections,

Translation into other languages, even if only on a subsection-by-subsection basis, and/or

Criticism or commentary in-lined into the text.

The ability to build into different formats, such as palm formats and better HTML.

If you inform me of your work, I will consider it and may include it in subsequent versions that I produce, subject to the provisions of the License. You may of course produce your own versions of this document without my knowledge, as explained in the License.
